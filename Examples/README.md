# SPOT-navigation

The project is divided into both social and navigation focused teams, both producing a database of
SPOTâ€™s data. This project aims to establish systems for data collection that can be used in future
research projects in the INSITE lab related to SPOT.

# E-Stop

To run the E-Stop as a GUI:
```
python3 estop_gui.py --username USER --password PASSWORD ROBOT_IP
```
To run the E-Stop without a GUI:
```
python3 estop_nogui.py --username USER --password PASSWORD ROBOT_IP
```

### GUI Version
The GUI version of the example has two buttons. The red `STOP` button
engages the robot's E-Stop system, which cuts off power to all the motors. This operation also
changes the E-Stop status to `ESTOP_LEVEL_CUT`. To release the E-Stop and transition the robot to
an operational state, press the green `Release` button.

### Command-line version without a GUI
Similar to the usage of the GUI version, the non-GUI version of the example uses `Space` for
engaging the E-Stop system and `r` for releasing it.
